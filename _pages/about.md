I am a **Researcher** and **Full-time Contract Professor** at the **[Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP)](https://www.pucp.edu.pe/en/)** and a member of the **[Artificial Intelligence Research & Development Group (AI-DII)](https://ai.dii.unipi.it/)**. I obtained my **PhD in Information Engineering** from the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english) (Supervisors: **[Prof. P. Ducange](https://www.unipi.it/en/about-us/organisation/people/pietro-ducange-42371-en/)**, **[Prof. A. Bechini](https://docenti.ing.unipi.it/a.bechini/BechiniHome.html)**, **[Prof. F. Marcelloni](https://docenti.ing.unipi.it/f.marcelloni/)**) and an **M.Sc. in Computer Engineering** (Cum Laude).

My work focuses on **Machine Learning**, **Federated Learning**, and **Explainable AI (XAI)**, approached from a distributed systems perspective. I combine algorithmic design with distributed execution to develop federated versions of explainable learning and clustering algorithms, ensuring their reliable execution to real-world conditions—often leveraging **actor-based designs in Erlang**. Drawing on 10+ years as a **Software Architect** and **Technical Lead** (e.g., Verizon), I design robust, production-ready systems with a focus on performance and scalability. My expertise includes **AWS cloud architecture**, **backend development** (Python, Java), and **performance optimization**.
